  "description": "Windows Recovery Partition Editor resizes the local Windows Recovery Partition to 984MB and injects CAB files to enable optional features and language support. It deploys via a PowerShell script, placing architecture-specific CABs under tools\\amd64 or tools\\arm64cpu and matching language packs, with an optional backup of OEM images. Detection uses the registry key HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\YourCompanyNameHere\\Client-Recovery with value 1.0.0.",

    "aiSummary": "The script is a legitimate admin tool for managing the Windows Recovery Environment but contains high-risk operations that can brick the system if misused. It does not download/execute remote code, harvest credentials, or exfiltrate data beyond logging. Recommendations: restrict usage to trusted admins, add robust error handling and environment validation, implement safety checks to prevent destructive actions, and review logging practices to avoid leaking sensitive information.",

If misused or dropped into an unmanaged system, it can brick the system or disable security features. It also copies WinRE images between partitions and moves WinRE, which could be leveraged for persistence or evasion if abused."
