  "description": "Windows Media Creation CLI is a PowerShell-based tool that automates building Windows installation media on a USB drive. It supports Windows 11 (22H2-25H2) and Windows 10, with customizable architecture, language, region and edition, enabling fully automated media creation. It also supports OEM driver injection via AUTOUNATTEND or DISM, single or multi-driver packs, and can generate an installwimdrivers.csv catalog to track installed drivers.",

    "aiSummary": "Overall assessment: The script is a legitimate admin tool for automating driver integration into Windows installation media. Security concerns primarily stem from downloading and executing external installers (remote code execution risk and supply-chain risk). There are no credentials or secrets embedded. A reliability/security bug is present due to an undefined baseDownloadUrl variable. Recommendations: validate driver package signatures, implement hash/signature checks on downloads, consider stricter URL trust controls, verify extracted contents before deployment, and run with least-privilege and, where possible, code-signing checks. Also consider adding explicit error handling for missing/undefined variables and runtime validations of downloaded artifacts.",
