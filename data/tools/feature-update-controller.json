  "description": "Feature Update Controller is a remediation package for Microsoft Intune that centralizes Windows feature upgrades with configurable setup, scripts, and custom actions. It generates and manages SetupConfig.ini, prestages Script Modules, and configures Custom Actions to tailor upgrade behavior, including post-install and rollback steps. The solution downloads and applies a manifest.json, stages scripts and actions, and supports updating or removing configurations on devices for a consistent upgrade experience.",

    "aiSummary": "The codebase shows no obfuscated payloads or hardcoded secrets. The primary security concern is dynamic module execution from registry entries (SetupComplete.ps1), which can lead to arbitrary code execution if registry data is compromised. A placeholder company name indicates a configuration issue. A geo-location collection path in Failure.ps1 raises privacy considerations regarding logging of coordinates, with potential exfiltration risk if logs are transmitted externally.",
