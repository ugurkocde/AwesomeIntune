  "description": "A wrapper app that uses ShellRunAs to launch a target executable under a defined Active Directory domain user from non-domain-joined Windows devices. It enables cloud-managed devices to run legacy on-prem tools (RSAT) by prompting for domain credentials and launching the configured app with elevated rights. It relies on simple domain.txt and app.txt configuration and is packaged for Intune with explicit install/uninstall commands and a Start Menu entry.",
