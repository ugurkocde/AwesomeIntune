  "description": "A wrapper app that uses ShellRunAs to launch a target executable under a defined Active Directory domain user from non-domain-joined Windows devices. It enables cloud-managed devices to run legacy on-prem tools (RSAT) by prompting for domain credentials and launching the configured app with elevated rights. It relies on simple domain.txt and app.txt configuration and is packaged for Intune with explicit install/uninstall commands and a Start Menu entry.",

    "aiSummary": "The codebase shows potential security concerns related to stealthy PowerShell execution, persistence-like installer behavior, and config-driven command construction. There is no evidence of remote script downloads, credential harvesting, or data exfiltration in the provided snippets. Treat as potentially risky admin tooling: enforce input validation, code signing, least privilege execution, and avoid bypassing PowerShell security policies.",
