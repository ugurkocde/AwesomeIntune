  "description": "Intune App Factory is a set of PowerShell scripts run in an Azure DevOps Pipeline that automatically detects, downloads, packages, and publishes onboarded applications as Win32 apps to Microsoft Intune, ensuring up-to-date deployments. It supports onboarding via manifests, integrates the PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit, and automates version checks from Winget, Evergreen, or Storage Account sources to streamline packaging and publishing.",

Primary concerns are potential remote code execution risk from dynamic module installation and information leakage via verbose error messages.
