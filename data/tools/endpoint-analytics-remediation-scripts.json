    "aiSummary": "The collection contains several legitimate admin/remediation tasks, but with notable security concerns: (1) data-loss risk from clearing Downloads, (2) destructive OS-component removal, (3) potential persistence/privilege-change risk via a Local Admin remediation, (4) risky use of Win32_Product for software detection, and (5) configuration hazards from hardcoded placeholders and registry policy changes. No obfuscated code, credential harvesting, or external data exfiltration detected.",
