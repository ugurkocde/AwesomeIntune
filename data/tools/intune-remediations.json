    "aiSummary": "Overall, the codebase does not exhibit obfuscated code, remote script downloads, credential harvesting, or data exfiltration. The primary concerns are some detection scripts with boolean-vs-string comparisons that can misreport device state, a hardcoded DNS configuration, and a registry change with unclear intent. These should be reviewed and corrected to avoid misconfiguration or inaccurate compliance reporting.",
