    "aiSummary": "The script largely adheres to Intune detection patterns, with no credential theft, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is a likely bug in uptime calculation due to a misnamed WMI property (LastBootUptime vs LastBootUpTime) that can affect detection logic. Additionally, remote config fetching requires appropriate trust controls and robust validation to prevent config tampering. Minor robustness improvements around error handling are recommended.",
