It deploys a Function App, Storage Account, and Key Vault, with the Remediation script driving log collection per LogsGatherRules.json and uploading a compressed archive to the logs container. Deployments support Azure Template Spec (Bicep/ARM) or direct ARM templates, with optional UI and post-deployment steps.",
