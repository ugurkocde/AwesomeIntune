  "description": "A Log Analytics dashboard to monitor Windows authentication method usage (WHfB vs password) across devices and users. It reads the SigninLogs table to report counts, trends and adoption, showing who uses WHfB, who uses passwords, and how usage evolves over time. It supports filtering by device, user and time, and includes a ready-to-import workbook (Workbook.json) to add the report to a Log Analytics workspace in Intune-managed environments.",
