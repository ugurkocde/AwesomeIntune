    "aiSummary": "The codebase includes several security concerns related to execution policy bypass and potential data exposure. Key issues: (1) policy bypass via -ex bypass in multiple startup wrappers, (2) possible data exfiltration risk from exporting sensitive encryption keys from Intune packages, (3) local credential/token storage using DPAPI with a per-user scope, and (4) UI/hiding mechanisms that could obscure execution. There are no evident hardcoded secrets nor confirmed remote code downloads in the provided snippets. Recommendations: remove or restrict execution policy bypass, restrict and audit encryption-key exporting, ensure strict access control on token caches, and document/limit UI hiding features with proper auditing.",
