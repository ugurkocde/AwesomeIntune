  "description": "This Intune-deployable script elevates the enrollment user to a local administrator on Windows devices. Packaged as an .INTUNEWIN app, it is deployed through Microsoft Intune to targeted users with install and uninstall commands to grant or revoke admin rights after enrollment. It uses a requirements check for detection and can be reconfigured later, providing an Autopilot-like capability fully managed by Intune.",

    "aiSummary": "The code primarily enables privilege elevation for an enrollment admin scenario (adding the user to Administrators). No credential theft or data exfiltration detected. Primary security considerations are the privilege escalation risk, potential execution-policy bypass, and error-suppression practices; mitigate with strict authorization, signing, and improved error handling.",
