  "description": "KuShu-Shimon Intune Stateful Device Fingerprinting (ISDF) provides a tamper-resistant device fingerprint for enrolled Windows devices, enforced via Intune Custom Compliance and DPAPI-encrypted baselines. In Cloud mode it attests fingerprints to Entra ID through APIM and a Logic App to enable trusted device filters, dynamic groups, and stronger Conditional Access policies. The solution collects on-device signals, stores encrypted baselines, self-heals missing keys, and reports ISDF booleans for compliant state.",
