    "aiSummary": "The codebase contains several remediation scripts that present significant risk: (1) data-destructive operations clearing user Downloads across multiple accounts; (2) ambiguous Local Admin management with placeholder values that could enable privilege abuse; (3) registry-based changes that weaken security controls for Adobe products (JavaScript, Flash); and (4) potential attempts to uninstall or evade device management (SCCM). These issues warrant strict access controls, safe-guarding (dry-run, prompts, backups), and thorough review before deployment in Intune/InSight workflows.",
